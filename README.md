# Hamiltonian bridge: A physics-driven generative framework for targeted pattern control

This project develops a framework for controlling pattern forming PDE systems, combining knowledge of a general class of dynamical laws for pattern formation in non-equilibrium systems, and stochastic optimal control. The framework relies on a mapping between stochastic many-body Lagrangian physics and deterministic Eulerian pattern forming PDEs and the Feynman-Kac adjoint path integral control. The term "Hamiltonian bridge" refers to the fact that the controlled pattern evolution takes the form of a Hamiltonian system connecting the inital to the target pattern.
